[Hadoop mini-clusters](http://www.lopakalogic.com/articles/hadoop-articles/hadoop-testing-with-minicluster/) - [https://github.com/sakserv/hadoop-mini-clusters](https://github.com/sakserv/hadoop-mini-clusters)


Docker-Ambari server (can be done on Mac), can be used to deploy a local cluster to test deployment.  Seems to be most useful for Ambari development, less so for the components.


`spark-submit` can be used locally.  It can also be used to connect to a cluster.  Used in local mode, and called from Scala or Java code, breakpoints can be inserted into developers code.
